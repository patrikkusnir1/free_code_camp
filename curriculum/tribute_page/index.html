    <h2 id="tribute-info">Timeline of Albert Einstein’s Life:</h2>

    <ol>
      <li><span class="bold">1879</span>Born in Ulm, Germany.</li>
      <li><span class="bold">1884</span>Received a compass from his father, sparking his fascination with science.</li>
      <li><span class="bold">1895</span>Failed his first entrance exam to the Swiss Federal Polytechnic in Zurich but
        later passed.</li>
      <li><span class="bold">1900</span>Graduated from the Swiss Federal Polytechnic with a diploma in mathematics and
        physics</li>
      <li><span class="bold">1905</span>Published four groundbreaking papers, including the Special Theory of Relativity
        (E=mc²), in his "Annus Mirabilis"
        (miracle year).</li>
      <li><span class="bold">1909</span>Became a professor of theoretical physics at the University of Zurich.</li>
      <li><span class="bold">1915</span>Completed the General Theory of Relativity, which redefined gravity.</li>
      <li><span class="bold">1919</span>Einstein’s theory was confirmed during a solar eclipse, making him world-famous.
      </li>
      <li><span class="bold">1921</span>Awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on the photoelectric effect.
      </li>
      <li><span class="bold">1933</span>Fled Nazi Germany and moved to the United States, joining the Institute for
        Advanced Study in Princeton.</li>
      <li><span class="bold">1939</span>Signed a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, warning about the potential
        of nuclear weapons (leading to the

      <li><span class="bold">1960s – present</span>His theories continue to shape modern physics, influencing fields
        like quantum mechanics and cosmology.</li>
      <li><span class="bold">2015</span>Gravitational waves, predicted by Einstein, were detected by LIGO, further
        confirming his work.</li>

      <blockquote>Einstein’s work paved the way for modern physics. His insights were not just revolutionary—they were a
        glimpse into the
        very fabric of reality.
