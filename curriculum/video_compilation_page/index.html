      <h2>Sicilian defense Snyder variation</h2>
      <p>2.b3 followed by 3.Bb2 is the Snyder Variation, named for USCF master Robert M. Snyder.[54] It has been used
        occasionally by Nigel Short and is a favourite of Georgian GM Tamaz Gelashvili.</p>

      <h2>Caro Kann defense - Two Knights attack</h2>
      <p>The Two Knights Variation 1.e4 c6 2.Nc3 d5 3.Nf3 (or 2.Nf3 d5 3.Nc3) was played by Bobby Fischer in his youth,
        but has
        since declined in popularity. White's intention is to benefit from rapid development as well as to retain
        options
        regarding the d-pawn. Black's logical and probably best reply is 3...Bg4. After 4.h3 Bxf3 5.Qxf3, the positional
        continuation, Black has the option of 5...Nf6 or 5...e6. The Retreat Line 4...Bh5 is playable but Black must be
        careful.
        In Noteboom–Mindeno 1927 Black lost quickly after 5.exd5 cxd5 6.g4 Bg6 7.Ne5 a6? (7...Nc6 is necessary) 8.h4 d4
        9.h5!
        dxc3 10.hxg6 cxd2+ 11.Qxd2 Qxd2+ 12.Bxd2 and Black must lose material.[7]

        This variation sets a trap: playing along the lines of the Classical Variation gets Black in trouble after
        3...dxe4
        4.Nxe4 Bf5 (4...Nd7 is playable) 5.Ng3 Bg6?! (5...Bg4) 6.h4 h6 7.Ne5 Bh7 (7...Qd6 may be best) 8.Qh5! g6
        (forced) 9.Bc4!
        e6 (9...gxh5?? 10.Bxf7#) 10.Qe2 with a huge advantage for White. Now 10...Qe7! is best. Instead,
        Lasker–Radsheer, 1908
        and Alekhine–Bruce, 1938 ended quickly after, respectively, 10...Bg7?? 11.Nxf7! and 10...Nf6?? 11.Nxf7![8][9]

        After the moves 1.e4 c6 2.Nc3 d5 3.Qf3!? (Goldman Variation), White's position is sound according to Graham
        Burgess.[10]</p>

      <h2>Vienna game</h2>
      <p>The Vienna Game is an opening in chess that begins with the moves:

        1. e4 e5
        2. Nc3
        White's second move is less common than 2.Nf3, and is also more recent.

        The original idea behind the Vienna Game was to play a delayed King's Gambit with f4 (the Vienna Gambit), but in
        modern
        play White often plays more quietly (for example, by fianchettoing their king's bishop with g3 and Bg2). Black
        most
        often continues with 2...Nf6. The opening can also lead to the Frankenstein–Dracula Variation.

        Weaver W. Adams famously claimed that the Vienna Game led to a forced win for White.[1] Nick de Firmian
        concludes in the
        15th edition of Modern Chess Openings, however, that the opening leads to equality with best play by both
        sides.[2]</p>
