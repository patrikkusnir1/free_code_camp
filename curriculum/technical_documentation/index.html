        Python Tutorial
      </header>


      <p>Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a
        simple but
        effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its
        interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on
        most
        platforms.</p>
      <p>The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely available in source or binary form for all
        major
        platforms from the Python web site, https://www.python.org/, and may be freely distributed. The same site also
        contains
        distributions of and pointers to many free third party Python modules, programs and tools, and additional
        documentation.</p>

      <p>If you do much work on computers, eventually you find that there’s some task you’d like to automate. For
        example, you
        may wish to perform a search-and-replace over a large number of text files, or rename and rearrange a bunch of
        photo
        files in a complicated way. Perhaps you’d like to write a small custom database, or a specialized GUI
        application, or a
        simple game.</p>
      <p>If you’re a professional software developer, you may have to work with several C/C++/Java libraries but find
        the usual
        write/compile/test/re-compile cycle is too slow. Perhaps you’re writing a test suite for such a library and find
        writing
        the testing code a tedious task. Or maybe you’ve written a program that could use an extension language, and you
        don’t
        want to design and implement a whole new language for your application.</p>

      <p>The Python interpreter is usually installed as /usr/local/bin/python3.13 on those machines where it is
        available;
        putting /usr/local/bin in your Unix shell’s search path makes it possible to start it by typing the command:</p>
      <p><code>python3.13</code></p>

        Informal Introduction

      <p>In the following examples, input and output are distinguished by the presence or absence of prompts (>>> and
        …): to
        repeat the example, you must type everything after the prompt, when the prompt appears; lines that do not begin
        with a
        prompt are output from the interpreter. Note that a secondary prompt on a line by itself in an example means you
        must
        type a blank line; this is used to end a multi-line command.</p>
      <p>You can toggle the display of prompts and output by clicking on >>> in the upper-right corner of an example
        box. If you
        hide the prompts and output for an example, then you can easily copy and paste the input lines into your
        interpreter.</p>
      <p>Many of the examples in this manual, even those entered at the interactive prompt, include comments. Comments
        in Python
        start with the hash character, #, and extend to the end of the physical line. A comment may appear at the start
        of a
        line or following whitespace or code, but not within a string literal. A hash character within a string literal
        is just
        a hash character. Since comments are to clarify code and are not interpreted by Python, they may be omitted when
        typing
        in examples.</p>
      <p>Some examples:</p>
      <code>
        # this is the first comment <br>
        spam = 1 # and this is the second comment <br>
        # ... and now a third! <br>
        text = "# This is not a comment because it's inside quotes." <br>
      </code>
      <p>The interpreter acts as a simple calculator: you can type an expression at it and it will write the value.
        Expression
        syntax is straightforward: the operators +, -, * and / can be used to perform arithmetic; parentheses (()) can
        be used
        for grouping. For example:</p>
      <code>
          2 + 2 <br>
          4 <br>
          50 - 5*6 <br>
          20 <br>
          (50 - 5*6) / 4 <br>
          5.0 <br>
          8 / 5 # division always returns a floating-point number <br>
          1.6 <br>
        </code>

      <p>As well as the while statement just introduced, Python uses a few more that we will encounter in this chapter.
      </p>
      <p>Perhaps the most well-known statement type is the if statement. For example:</p>
      <code>
        x = int(input("Please enter an integer: ")) <br>
        Please enter an integer: 42 <br>
        if x < 0:  <br>
        x=0 print('Negative changed to zero') 
        elif x==0: print('Zero') <br> 
        elif x==1: print('Single') <br> 
        else: print('More') <br>
        More
      </code>
      <p>The for statement in Python differs a bit from what you may be used to in C or Pascal. Rather than always
        iterating over
        an arithmetic progression of numbers (like in Pascal), or giving the user the ability to define both the
        iteration step
        and halting condition (as C), Python’s for statement iterates over the items of any sequence (a list or a
        string), in
        the order that they appear in the sequence. For example (no pun intended):</p>
      <code>
        # Measure some strings: <br>
        words = ['cat', 'window', 'defenestrate'] <br>
        for w in words: <br>
        print(w, len(w)) <br>
        
        cat 3 <br>
        window 6 <br>
        defenestrate 12 <br>
      </code>
