    <p class="author">By Alex Peterson</p>
    <p class="text">The city council has announced a large-scale renovation of Central Park, aiming to improve green
      spaces and add new recreational areas. The project, set to begin in June, includes new walking paths, upgraded
      playgrounds, and
      additional seating areas for visitors.</p>
    <p class="text">Officials say the renovation is part of a broader effort to make the city more eco-friendly and
      pedestrian-friendly.
      Local residents have welcomed the news, though some have raised concerns about temporary disruptions during
      construction.</p>
